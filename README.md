Creating an Account: The BankAccount class is instantiated with an account number, account holder name, and an initial balance. Checking Balance: The check_balance method returns the current balance of the account. Depositing Money: The deposit method increases the account balance by the deposit amount. It raises an error if the amount is non-positive. Withdrawing Money: The withdraw method decreases the account balance by the withdrawal amount. It raises an error if the amount is non-positive or exceeds the available balance. This code provides a simple and clear way to manage basic banking operations in Python
